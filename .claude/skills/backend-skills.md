# Backend Skills

This document outlines the skills and best practices for backend development and server-side programming.

## Core Backend Skills

### Programming Languages
- Proficiency in backend languages (Python, Java, Node.js, Go, etc.)
- Understanding of language-specific ecosystems and libraries
- Performance considerations and optimization techniques
- Memory management and garbage collection

### API Development

- GraphQL schema design and resolvers
- API versioning and deprecation strategies
- Rate limiting and throttling mechanisms

### Server Architecture
- Microservices vs monolithic architecture patterns
- Service discovery and load balancing
- Containerization and orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Message queues and event-driven architecture

## Advanced Backend Skills

### Security Implementation
- Authentication and authorization frameworks
- OAuth, JWT, and session management
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure coding practices and vulnerability prevention

### Performance Optimization
- Caching strategies (Redis, Memcached)
- Database query optimization
- Asynchronous processing and background jobs
- Resource pooling and connection management

### Monitoring and Observability
- Application logging and structured logging
- Metrics collection and alerting
- Distributed tracing and debugging
- Health checks and circuit breakers

## Backend Frameworks and Libraries

### Web Frameworks
