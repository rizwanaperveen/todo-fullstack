# Testing Skills

This document outlines the skills and best practices for software testing across different levels and methodologies.

## Core Testing Skills

### Testing Fundamentals
- Understanding different types of testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- Test-driven development (TDD) and behavior-driven development (BDD)
- Writing effective test cases and assertions
- Test data management and fixtures

### Test Pyramid Implementation
- Unit testing for individual components
- Integration testing for component interactions
- End-to-end testing for user flows
- API testing for service interfaces

### Quality Assurance Concepts
- Defect identification and classification
- Risk-based testing strategies
- Test coverage measurement and goals
- Exploratory testing techniques

## Advanced Testing Skills

### Automated Testing
- Continuous integration and testing pipelines
- Parallel test execution and optimization
- Mocking and stubbing dependencies
- Test environment setup and management

### Performance Testing
- Load testing and stress testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Bottleneck identification
- Scalability validation

### Security Testing
- Vulnerability scanning and assessment
- Penetration testing basics
