# Architecture Skills

This document outlines the skills and best practices for software architecture design and implementation.

## Core Architecture Skills

### System Design
- Understanding system requirements and constraints
- Designing scalable and maintainable architectures
- Selecting appropriate architectural patterns
- Creating system diagrams and models

### Technology Selection
- Evaluating technology stacks and frameworks
- Assessing trade-offs between different approaches
- Considering performance, scalability, and security
- Planning for future growth and evolution

### Design Patterns
- Applying proven design patterns appropriately
- Understanding when to use specific patterns
- Creating reusable and modular components
- Balancing flexibility and complexity

## Advanced Architecture Skills

### Scalability Planning
