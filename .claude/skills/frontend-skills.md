# Frontend Skills

This document outlines the skills and best practices for frontend development and user interface implementation.

## Core Frontend Skills

### HTML/CSS Fundamentals
- Semantic HTML markup and accessibility
- CSS layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid)
- Responsive design and mobile-first approach
- Cross-browser compatibility and normalization

### JavaScript Proficiency
- ES6+ features and modern JavaScript
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Asynchronous programming (Promises, async/await)
- Functional and object-oriented programming patterns

### UI/UX Implementation
- Translating design mockups to code
- Component-based architecture
- State management and data flow
- Animation and micro-interaction implementation

## Advanced Frontend Skills

### Framework Expertise
- React, Vue, Angular, or other modern frameworks
- Component lifecycle and hooks
- Virtual DOM concepts and reconciliation
- State management libraries (Redux, Vuex, etc.)

### Performance Optimization
- Bundle size optimization and code splitting
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Rendering performance and virtualization
- Progressive web app (PWA) features

### Build Tools and Tooling
- Module bundlers (Webpack, Vite, Parcel)
- Package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm)
- Linting and formatting tools (ESLint, Prettier)
- Development server and hot reloading

## Modern Frontend Practices

### Responsive and Adaptive Design

- Breakpoints and adaptive layouts
- Touch-friendly interfaces
- Performance on low-powered devices

### Accessibility (a11y)
- ARIA attributes and semantic markup
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast and visual design

### Testing Strategies
- Unit testing for components
- Integration and end-to-end testing
- Visual regression testing
- Accessibility testing

## Frontend Architecture

### Component Architecture
- Reusable component design
- Component composition patterns
- Design systems and style guides
- Component documentation and storybooks

### State Management
- Local component state vs global state
- Flux/Redux patterns and alternatives
- Client-side caching strategies
- Server state synchronization

### Routing and Navigation
- Client-side routing implementation
- Code splitting by route
- Navigation guards and middleware
- SEO considerations for SPAs

## Performance and Optimization

### Loading Performance
- Critical rendering path optimization
- Resource prioritization and preloading
- Font loading strategies
- Third-party script management

### Runtime Performance
