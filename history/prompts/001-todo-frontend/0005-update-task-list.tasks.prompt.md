# Prompt History Record: Update Task List

## Original Prompt
```

```

## Response Summary
Updated the task list to address critical constitution alignment issues identified in the analysis. Added functional requirement references to tasks and marked constitution compliance items as completed.

## Outcome Impact
Improved task list alignment with functional requirements and constitution principles, enhancing traceability and compliance.

## Files Summary
- specs/001-todo-frontend/tasks.md: Updated task list with functional requirement references and constitution compliance

## Tests Summary
None - This was a task list improvement exercise without specific test requirements.

## Next Prompts
- /sp.implement: To execute the implementation plan with improved task alignment
- /sp.analyze: To verify the updated task list meets quality standards

## Reflection Note
The updated task list now includes functional requirement references (FR-001 through FR-012) to improve traceability and ensure all requirements are covered.

## Failure Modes Observed
No failure modes observed - all updates were applied successfully.

## Next Experiment to Improve Prompt Quality
Consider implementing automated validation during task generation to ensure constitution compliance and requirement traceability.
